# TypeScript Array vs. String Argument

This example demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: passing an array to a function that expects a string argument.  The TypeScript compiler will correctly flag this as an error because of type mismatch. The solution involves ensuring the function receives the correct type of data or handling the array appropriately before passing it to the function.
